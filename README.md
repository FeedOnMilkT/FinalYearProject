# Final Year Project Based on OpenPCDet: Enhanced 3D Object Detection Framework

## Introduction:

This research project extends OpenPCDet to advance the state-of-the-art in 3D object detection. Our work focuses on enhancing detection performance through architectural innovations while maintaining real-world applicability.

The primary objectives include optimizing existing 3D backbone networks and exploring novel architectures to improve detection accuracy and efficiency. We are investigating potential improvements to the core detection pipeline through sophisticated backbone network modifications and innovative feature extraction approaches.

For enhanced real-world performance, we are exploring multi-modal fusion techniques to leverage complementary sensor data, potentially improving detection accuracy in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we are developing optimization strategies specifically targeted at edge computing platforms like NVIDIA Jetson devices, ensuring robust real-time performance even with limited computational resources.

This project aims to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art detection performance and practical deployment requirements, making advanced 3D object detection more accessible for real-world applications.

Built upon OpenPCDet

`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[PointRCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04244), [`[Part-A2-Net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670), [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192), [`[Voxel R-CNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15712), [`[PV-RCNN++]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00463) and [`[MPPNet]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05979). 

**Highlights**: 
* `OpenPCDet` has been updated to `v0.6.0` (Sep. 2022).
* The codes of PV-RCNN++ has been supported.
* The codes of MPPNet has been supported. 
* The multi-modal 3D detection approaches on Nuscenes have been supported.

## Introduction


### What does `OpenPCDet` toolbox do?

Note that we have upgrated `PCDet` from `v0.1` to `v0.2` with pretty new structures to support various datasets and models.

`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.

Based on `OpenPCDet` toolbox, we win the Waymo Open Dataset challenge in [3D Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-detection/), 
[3D Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-tracking/), [Domain Adaptation](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/domain-adaptation/) 
three tracks among all LiDAR-only methods, and the Waymo related models will be released to `OpenPCDet` soon.    

We are actively updating this repo currently, and more datasets and models will be supported soon. 
Contributions are also welcomed. 

### `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:
